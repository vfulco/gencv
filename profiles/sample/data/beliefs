The cheapest way to do R&D is to wait til somebody else does something first, then blatantly copy them. We can then write down a huge chunk of spending to R&D in our books, which keeps our reported profits lower than otherwise, while never actually taking most of the real risk & effort involving in doing real, original, R&D. You did not hear me say that in public.
