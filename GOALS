Project Goals:
    1. enable me to solve the "multiple resume version/format permutation" problem once and for all, and to keep a website-based online CV in synch with all traditional printed/file resumes
    2. provide useful functionality that LinkedIn isn't providing for some bizarre reason
    3. feature set biased towards software developers and eclectic intellectual/creative types
    4. be a fun, small Python web project and productive use of my time
    5. when others see the code/package/design it should act to promote me by providing evidence of my design & coding abilities (such as they are *cough*)

Design Principles:
    1. automate: everything
    2. DRY: single data model expression then all else generated from it
    3. KISS: command-line tool, no mouse needed, no fancy/pricy apps, no fancy-shmancy server-side requirements or unnecessary tech (no database, web framework, AJAX, Javascript)
    4. high performance web site (small pages, everything static, totally cacheable)
    5. The only requirements for a customer/installer of this product is that they have Python somewhere (to generate all the pages), and that they already have (or can install/configure) a place where they have web server that can serve the static pages generated by my stuff. Okay and the ReportLab Python module. That's it. And...these bright red cloaks. But that's really it. Fear, surprise -- amongst our weaponry, are fear, surprise -- Well I didn't expect a sort of Spanish Inquisition!
